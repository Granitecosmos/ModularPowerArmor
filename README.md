# Modular Power Armor
Ever wondered why the Power Armor doesn't cover some bodyparts like the hands? Ever got annoyed because you can't have your truly lategame equipment because even Legendary Power Armors aren't adequate?

**Well fear not, for I bring you Modular Power Armor!**

Probably inspired by Fallout 4's system and the fact that vanilla Power Armor kinda sucks, this aims to fix the issue!

- Five tiers of Power Armor, the higher you go the better it becomes!
- Modular means every full set consists of four pieces: Chest, Leg, Arm and Helmet. All four combined covers the entire body! Certain pieces will have specific bonuses at higher tiers, like Leg pieces adding an additional speed boost.
- Cost also scales with tier, higher tiers requiring more advanced materials to craft!
- Higher tier version requires the lower tier one in the crafting recipe. No waste, feel free to build the lower tiers because you'll have to anyway!
- Additional research because this is supposed to be lategame stuff!
- It takes considerable amounts of crafting time to get from the first tier to the last. Which means, you now have stuff to do lategame! Yay!
- No new Workbenches because my Workshop is already 9001 tiles large. Seriously, it can get so out of hand with many mods...
- The only way you can get these is by crafing! You won't find it as loot, nor can you buy it from traders. You have to work for your overpowered armor!

***But wait, there's more!***

Now you can disassemble your vanilla Power Armors and get all the materials back that you need to craft one. You can use this to either reroll quality by disassembling and recrafting (which also fixes the damage) or to use the materials to make my Modular Power Armor!

All Power Armors now require Fusion Cores to craft. You can get these by disassembling vanilla Power Armor, disassembling Mechanoids or just being lucky enough to find some in an exotic trader's stock.

Let's not forget another small thing. These things cost a lot and I mean A LOT to make. It would be kinda pointless to craft them without any way to fix them up since it costs A LOT to craft these, both resource- and time-wise. So you can "recalibrate" the highest tier pieces for some materials to essentially recraft them, fixing any damage. Isn't that nice?

**However, all this power comes at a cost. In this case the cost is the Tech Tree.**
Since the current iteration isn't exactly mod-friendly, especially not so when we include several mods, I didn't even bother with coordinates. So please use a mod that reverts the Tech Screen to pre-A16 state. Honestly, since Tynan is a cool guy who wants the game to be mod-friendly, the Tech Tree will change anyway so it isn't such a huge loss.
I personally recommend skyarkhangel's **[Old style research menu mod](https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=28609.0)**.

## Balance
Is this balanced?
Honestly, is vanilla RimWorld balanced? **OF COURSE NOT!**

I really tried to make it kinda balanced. The problem with the original Power Armor is that it's market value is way overpriced compared to the benefits *in my opinion*. Couple this with the flawed quality system where Legendary has double the armor but also has **SIX TIMES** higher market value! Since the power budget of Raids depends on the total market value of your colonies this can easily get out of hand. So how to fix this?

Easy! Since the problem is too high base value and ridiculous quality price scaling, I've removed the quality from these and made sure their value-to-protection scales better the higher tier you craft. This also prevents quality trolling, when your high level crafter rolls a shoddy Power Armor.

Don't forget that this means that any Outfit you want to include these new armors **must have normal quality enabled** otherwise you'll have to manually force wear. You have been warned!

As for balance, the first tier is basically the same as vanilla but can cover the hand too. The last tier makes you more powerful than a Centipede, 90% damage reduction and 90% chance to deflect damage. You'll have a long journey ahead of you to get there though...

## Credits
*I'd like to thank Ykara for giving me permission to use and modify the source of A12 EPOE. I've created this mod back in A12 for personal use and I wanted to achieve something I thought was only possible via C#. It turned out that wasn't really the case but I did anyway since this was my first DLL mod project ever and indeed I was successful. I didn't carry the DLL over to A13 though.*

*I'd also like to thank Shinzy for giving me permission to use two textures from the old A12 Apparello mod. These two textures are assigned to be the display textures for every Arm and Leg piece of the Modular Armor sets.*

*And lastly, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank Thirite for pointing out the obvious, allowing me to fix the last thing missing from the mod to finally be release-worthy.*

I'd like to mention here that the (rather shoddy) texture for the Fusion Core was made by me. Feel free to do whatever you want with it. If you think you can make something similar that's better, feel free to send me a PM. It's really just a placeholder right now.

The rest of the textures included are vanilla textures.
